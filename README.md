# EasyList – Backend API

EasyList is a backend application that supports a simple shopping list–style application.
The backend is implemented using Django REST Framework (DRF).

The purpose of the backend is to provide a clear and structured API for managing application data, such as products and other related information used by the frontend.

The backend is designed to support:
- retrieving product data
- adding and managing products
- providing a foundation for future features

The API is built to be straightforward and easy to extend as the application evolves.

In addition to the shopping list functionality, the backend is planned to support a Notes feature, allowing users to store and manage personal notes. This functionality is under ongoing development.

EasyList is a personal learning project focused on understanding how frontend and backend parts work together in a real-world–style application.

## Status
- Core API structure: implemented
- Product-related functionality: implemented
- Notes functionality: planned / under development
